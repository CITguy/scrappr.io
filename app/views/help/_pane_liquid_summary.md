## Summary
Scrappr makes use of the Liquid templating library to provide useful
functionality within your endpoint content.  Such functionality includes:

* **Params** - Access to submitted parameters
* **Headers** - Access to submitted headers
* **Fake** - Generated Data (powered by Faker)


### Getting Started
I would highly recommend brushing up on how to use Liquid by reading
"Liquid for Designers". This tutorial shows how to make use of the basic
features provided by Liquid.
